## Featured Projects

### **[AI Gateway - DDD + Hexagonal Architecture](https://github.com/mahdighadiriii/AiGateway-DDD-Hexagonal)**
*Primary Focus Project - Q1 2025*

Enterprise-grade AI Gateway demonstrating advanced software architecture patterns for multi-provider LLM routing and management. A showcase of clean architecture principles applied to modern AI infrastructure.

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Pure DDD Implementation** with bounded contexts: Completion Context, Billing Context, Workflow Context, Platform Context
- **Hexagonal Architecture** with strict port/adapter separation ensuring framework independence
- **Shared Kernel** for cross-cutting domain concepts and events
- **Strategic Design Patterns**: Factory, Strategy, Decorator for routing and caching logic
- **Value Objects** for type safety: Cost, ModelName, Prompt, Tokens
- **Domain Services** for complex business logic (Provider Factory, Routing Strategies)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Multi-provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) with unified interface
- Intelligent routing strategies: cost optimization, quality prioritization, speed optimization
- Application layer with use cases, DTOs, and cross-cutting concerns (cache, retry decorators)
- Infrastructure layer with adapters for external systems (cache, persistence, providers)
- Comprehensive test coverage following testing pyramid

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Domain-Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, Poetry, pytest

**Why This Matters:** Demonstrates ability to architect complex systems following enterprise patterns, separating business logic from infrastructure concerns, and building maintainable, testable code at scale.
